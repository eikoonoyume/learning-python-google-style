# Reading Data Interactively
# interact with user to get info
# input function: allows us to prompt user for certain value to use in scripts
# example script = hello.py
cat hello.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

name = input("Please enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name)

./hello.py
Please enter your name: Roger
# output: Hello, Roger
# input function always returns string
# convert string to format that reads numbers or dates
# define function that converts hours, minutes, seconds into seconds
def to_seconds(house, minutes, seconds):
  return hours*3600+minutes*60+seconds
# program starts with a welcome message
print("Welcome to this time converter")

# enter while loop after initializing cont variable
cont = "y"
while(cont.lower() == "y"):
# ask user to provide numbers, converting value using int function
  hours = int(input("Enter the number of hours: "))
  minutes = int(input("Enter the number of minutes: "))
  seconds = int(input("Enter the number of seconds: "))
  print("That's {} seconds".format(to_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds))
  print()
  cont = input("Do you want to do another conversion? [y to continue] ")
print("Goodbye!")
# resulting script
./seconds.py
Welcome to this time converter
Enter the number of hours: 1
Enter the number of minutes: 2
Enter the number of seconds: 3
# output: That's 3723 seconds

Do you want to do another conversion? [y to continue] y
Enter the number of hours: 3
Enter the number of minutes: 2
Enter the number of seconds: 1
# output: That's 10921 seconds

Do you want to do another conversion? [y to continue] n
# output: Goodbye!

# Standard Streams
# I/O streams = input output streams = pathways between programs and input sources (keyboard) and output (screen)
# STDIN = standard input stream, channel between program and input in form of text data from keyboard
# STDOUT = standard output stream, pathway between program and target/output like display
# STDOUT = form of text displayed in TERMINAL
# STDERR = standard error, displays output like STDOUT
# STDERR = specifically used to show error messages and program diagnostics, printed to screen
cat streams.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
data = input("This will come from STDIN: ")
print("Now we write it to STDOUT: " + data)
print("Now we generate an error to STDERR: " + data + 1)
# error generated by concatenating string to an integer

./streams.py
This will come from STDIN: Python Rocks!
Now we write it to STDOUT: Python Rocks!
** Error message appears here **

# cat system command displays contents, printed to terminal using STDOUT
cat greeting.txt
Well hello there, STDOUT

# unsupported flag with ls system generates an error
cat greeting.txt
Well hello there, STDOUT

ls -z
** Invalid option message appears **

# Environment Variables
# shell = application that reads and executes our commands, command-line interface that interacts with OS
# bash = most commonly used shell on Linux
# Zsh and Fish are popular shells
# environment variables = another source of info for scripts
# use env or env command to check variables
# path variable = important
# echo command = prints contents in Linux shell
# access value of variable by putting a dollar sign $ prefix on the name of varaible
echo $PATH
# contents of path variable, directories listed
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
cat variables.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os

# environ dictionary from OS module, using dictionary method
# GET method is similar to access dictionary values
print("SHELL: " + os.environ.get("SHELL", ""))
print("FRUIT: " + os.environ.get("FRUIT", ""))
# when value isn't present, retrieve value from dictionary using os.environ[FRUIT]
# if key isn't present, then error
# use GET method instead to sepcify what value should be returned if key isn't present
./variables.py

# Command-Line Arguments and Exit Status
# provide info to programs through command-line arguments
# as parameters passed to program
# no need for interactive user input
# useful for system administration tasks
# specify info we want to use before starting to create more automation
# argv in sys module = access values of argument
cat parameters.py

print(sys.argv)

./parameters.py
['./parameters.py']
# single element

# pass more parameters
./parameters.py one two three

# Exit Status
# exit status/return code = provides another source of info between shell and programs
# value returned to program by shell
# exit status = 0 when process succeeds, not 0 if fails
# actual number gives info on what kind of error
# check the exit status, use special variable to see exit status of last executed command
# WC command = counts the number of lines, words, and characters in a file
# pass variables.py script

# Input Functions
# Python 2 vs Python 3
# Python 2, using raw_input() to input from user
>>> my_number = raw_input('Please Enter a Number: \m')
Please Enter a Number:
1337
>>> print(my_number)
1337

# raw_input does not evaluate, just gets string from user
>>> my_raw_input = raw_input('Please Enter a Number: \n')
Please Enter a Number:
123 + 1 # treated like a raw string
>>> my_input = input('Please Enter a Number: \n')
Please Enter a Number:
123 + 1 # treated like an expression
>>> print(my_raw_input)
123 + 1
>>> print(my_input)
124 # expression was evaluated and math happened!

# Python 3, using input()
