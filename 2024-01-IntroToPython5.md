  # The replace_ending function replaces a specified substring at the end of a given sentence with a new substring. If the specified substring does not appear at the end of the given sentence, no action is performed and the original sentence is returned. If there is more than one occurrence of the specified substring in the sentence, only the substring at the end of the sentence is replaced. For example, replace_ending("abcabc", "abc", "xyz") should return abcxyz, not xyzxyz or xyzabc. The string comparison is case-sensitive, so replace_ending("abcabc", "ABC", "xyz") should return abcabc (no changes made).

  #Consider the following scenario about using Python lists: 
  # A professor gave his two assistants, Aniyah and Imani, the task of keeping an attendance list of students in the order they arrived in the classroom. Aniyah was the first one to note which students arrived, and then Imani took over. After class, they each entered their lists into the computer and emailed them to the professor. The professor wants to combine the two lists into one and sort it in alphabetical order. 
  # Complete the code by combining the two lists into one and then sorting the new list. This function should:
  # accept two lists through the function’s parameters;,
  # combine the two lists; USE +
  # sort the combined list in alphabetical order; USE .sort()
  # return the new list.
  def alphabetize_lists(list1, list2):
    new_list = [] # initialize new list

    new_list = alphabetize_list # make the new_list the alphabetize_list
    return new_list
  Aniyahs_list = ["Jacomo", "Emma", "Uli", "Nia", "Imani"]

The function receives two variables and should return the list of squares that occur between the “start” and “end” variables inclusively (meaning the range should include both the “start” and “end” values).

  # Consider the following scenario about using Python dictionaries and lists: 
  # Tessa and Rick are hosting a party. Before they send out invitations, they want to add all of the people they are inviting to a dictionary so they can also add how many guests each friend is bringing to the party.  
  # Complete the function so that it accepts a list of people, then iterates over the list and adds all of the names (elements) to the dictionary as keys with a starting value of 0. Tessa and Rick plan to update these values with the number of guests their friends will bring with them to the party. Then, print the new dictionary.
  # This function should:
  # accept a list variable named “guest_list” through the function’s parameter;
  # add the contents of the list as keys to a new, blank dictionary;
  # assign each new key with the value 0;
  # print the new dictionary.

  # Use a dictionary to count the frequency of numbers in the given “text” string. Only numbers should be counted. Do not count blank spaces, letters, or punctuation.
